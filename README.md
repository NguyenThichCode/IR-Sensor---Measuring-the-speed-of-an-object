# If your LCD isn't working (the backlight is on but no text appears), it is likely because there isn't enough voltage or current to power all components simultaneously.

To fix this, follow these steps:

Upload the code first: Disconnect the VCC wires of both IR sensors, leaving only the LCD connected, then click Upload.

Reconnect power afterward: Once the code has uploaded successfully, plug the IR sensors' VCC wires back into the 5V rail on the breadboard.
